1. Python has `namedtuple` where you can create tuple with attributes.  

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# first argument    : the name of the tuple
# second argument   : comma separated attributes quoted in a single string 
Person = namedtuple("Person", "name, bio")
me = Person("paradox", "I know nothing")
```

The value of the tuple can be accessed using the attributes as:

```python
print(me.name)
```

> namedtuple is elegant, easy and fast if you don't want to create a custom class just to store attributes/values

- Goto **Visual Block** mode using `ctrl-v`
- Jump to end of line using standard `$` symbol
- Press **A**. Then type in your text

1. **Python** : python dictionaries and lists can be recursive  
    i.e. they can contain themselves:

```python
x = {}
x['x'] = x
print(x)

# output :  {'x': {...}}
```

Same can be for lists too.
> I don't see any practical use case for this though
